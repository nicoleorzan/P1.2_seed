There may be statistical fluctuations when this small code is profiled by gprof,
especially when the single run does not last "enough".

If you take into account that gprof has a fixed sampling rate of 100 samples/sec,
we could say that "enough" means at least 30secs. A "better enough" is about 1 minute.

In any case, there is an additional workaround: the stacking of different profiling
results for the final analysis.
It works like the following:

[ 1] compile your code with -g -pg, and you run the $executable with suitable parameters

[ 2] rename the resulting gmon.out in, say, gmon.stack
      mov gmon.out gmon.stack 

[ 3] run again $executable, again with suitable (perhaps different) parameters

[ 4] stack the results:
      gprof -s $executable gmon.out gmon.stack

[ 5] repeat the steps [3 -4] how many times you feel adequate

[ 6] analyze the final stacked result with gprof
      gprof [options] $executable gmon.stack  [ > analysis | pipeline to other utilities like gprof2dot ]
      

Hope this may help.
However, that is nothing more than in the manual :)
