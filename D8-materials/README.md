## D8: hands-on and exercises 


###  run IMPI benchmark (ping-pong) to measure latency among MPI processes assigned on different cores 

You will run intel MPI ping-pong benchmark among to processors within the same node and you will try to estimate latency and bandwidth.

### Exercise 2: compile and run nodeperf.c program 

see readme.md file within the subdirectory 
 

### Exercise 3:  get HPCG benchmark and compile it 


steps: 

- Get the HPCG package from netlib::http://www.hpcg-benchmark.org/downloads/hpcg-3.0.tar.gz   


- Compile the package against MKL library
