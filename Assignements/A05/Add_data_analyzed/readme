In this folder you can find all the data I have obtained from the different runs of the code.

'No Blocks': this folder contains the data related to the given code 'transpose.c'.
I analyzed matrices of sizes 1024, 2048 and 4096. I took transposing times and cache misses data.

'Blocks': this folder contains the data related to the code transpose_blocks.c, so the implementation of the fast transpose. As before I analyzed matrices of sizes 1024, 2048 and 4096, using blocks of sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 256 and 512. I took transposing times and cache misses data.

I tought this folder was useful because the graphs of the data in the report seem maybe too much perfect.
